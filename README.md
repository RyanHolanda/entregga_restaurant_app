# Why
I decided to develop this app/site 'cause my uncle has a restaurant, and when I helped him, I saw they use whatsapp to send addresses to his couriers. And some mistakes can occur doing that, the information is not too clear to courier. So, I decided to create a Application to courier (You can see here https://github.com/RyanHolanda/entregga_courier_app). And a website to restaurant add adresses to courier.

# How to use
To use the website go to https://entregga-6d50c.web.app/#/ and use test crendentials, ((Email: teste@teste.com)) ((Password: teste123)). You can add a courier to your restaurant by clicking in + Adicionar Entregador and entering a name there. Now you open the courier page and add addresses information. Now you can send that to courier. The Courier need to login in his application with "ID da loja" and "ID do entregador(Can be found at left in courier screen)" and after login, the courier can see all addresses sent to him

# Database
I Used firebase in this application/website 'cause it's the best free, fast, easy-to-use, and cloud database.
